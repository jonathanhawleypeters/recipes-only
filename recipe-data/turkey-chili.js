    items: [

      "2 (15 ½ ounce) cans kidney beans, drained and rinsed",
      "1 large onion, chopped",
      "1 large tomato, chopped",
      "½ lb carrots, peeled and sliced",

  instructions: [
    "In a large skillet, brown the ground turkey, one pound at a time, over high heat together with the onions. If your skillet or wok is large enough, you can brown the turkey all at once to save time.",
    "On the last batch, add the spices after the turkey is browned and continue frying for another couple of minutes.",
    "Add the browned turkey to a very large pot with a lid, and then add the beans, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, and V8 juice.",
